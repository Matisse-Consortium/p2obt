------------------
Night-Plan Parsing
------------------

Night/observation plans ((.txt)-files) created with the idl-tool :bash:`calibrator_find.pro` by R. van Boekel (optional)
can be parsed into dictionaries to be used by other parts of the program.
The parser

* looks for the **runs** and splits them into individual keys/sections (see :ref:`Run Names`).
* looks for the **nights** and then splits them into keys/sections as well (see :ref:`Night Names`).
* ignores comments and other things in between the lines and automatically creates the 
* in conjunction with the :func:`create_obs <p2obt.automate.create_obs>`-function, can autodetect many things (see :ref:`Formatting Guidelines`).

The **night** sections are ended as soon as a line containing the **cal_find**
software name is detected.

Formatting Guidelines
=====================

In order to even better utilise the parser it is helpful to adhere to some
guidlines while writting the night/observation plans.
These are outlined in the following:

.. note::

   The parser will only identify sections of a file as a run, that contain a line
   starting with **run** (optional)

   The parser will only identify sections of a file as a run, that contain a line
   starting with **run** (optional).

.. warning::
   :name: Important Notice

   In order for the parser to work within individual nights /runs, i.e., the individual
   observing blocks, the SCI-CAL (or CAL-SCI-CAL, SCI-CAL-SCI, or any combination) needs
   to be separated from the next (SCI-CAL, etc.) observing block by a white line or
   a comment (a line starting with #).
   In case for files that end on such an observation block, a white line should be added
   to ensure the proper functioning of the parser.


Run Names
---------

.. note::

   If no run is detected then the whole file will be identified as one run and
   attributed to be a **full_run**.

Additionally, if the run name has a certain shape/format, then the 
:func:`create_obs <p2obt.automate.create_obs>` function
can automatically determine the following things about the run:

* The **program id** (and by this the container id on p2)
* The **array configuration** (*UTs, small, medium, large, extended*)
* The **operational mode** (*MATISSE, GRA4MAT*)
* The **resolution** (*LOW/LR, MED/MEDIUM/MR or HIGH/HR*)
* Additionally, the **type** of the run can be determined (i.e, *Imaging/Image*)

.. note:: 

   The parser is insensitive to the order and capitalization of the above settings as long as they are separetd by whitespace.

Here are some examples,

.. admonition:: File Contents

   .. parsed-literal::

      run 2, 111.253T.002 - UTs, MATISSE, med
      run 2, 111.253T.002 - smallATs, gra4mat, med
      run 3, 109.2313.003 = 0109.C-0413(C), MATISSE, ATs large array MR
      run 3, 109.2313.003 = 0109.C-0413(C), MATISSE, ATs large array MR, Image.

If there are no global arguments to be parsed in the run names, then the parser will look for them in the comments before the individual blocks
either contained in the nights,

   .. parsed-literal::

      run 3, 109.2313.003 = 0109.C-0413(C), ATs large array

      ...

This will properly parse that the first target `HD 104234` will be in medium resolution for MATISSE standalone and the second one
will be for GRA4MAT for low resolution.


Night Names
-----------

.. note::

   If no night is detected within a run then the whole run will be identified as one
   night and attributed to be a **full_night**.

The parser can also identify individual nights that are contained within a run by
lines starting with **night** that are followed up by some block containing
science targets and calibrators. This means, there is no need to avoid the word night
to, for instance, give a more detailed description in the night plan for the observers
at other locations.

Here are a few examples will be parsed properly:

.. admonition:: File Contents

   .. parsed-literal::

      obs-night 1 (27 dec): twilight + 0.5bn
      Night 1 - 27 December
      night 1:  1.6h1, formal duration our slot = 08:53 - 16:57 LST  =  23:38 - 07:42 UTC  =  01:38 - 09:42 CEST
      night 2, June 6:

.. note::

   If the above examples are not directly followed by a science target-calibrator block they may
   occur anywhere in the file and it will be parsed properly.

OB-Creation
-----------

The ob-creation scripts (for multiple obs :func:`create_obs <p2obt.automate.create_obs>`
or for singular obs :func:`create_ob <p2obt.automate.create_ob>`).
These scripts automatically...

* queries different catalogs (*simbad, gaia, tycho, 2mass, mdfc, and the local catalogs*).
* sort them into folders in the order given (either CAL-SCI or SCI-CAL or CAL-SCI-CAL) locally.
* sort them into containers during the upload, directly to P2.

For more details see the documentation or scripts in the `examples/ <https://github.com/Matisse-Consortium/p2obt/tree/main/examples>`_ directory
or the :ref:`Getting Started <getting_started>` section.
To add new local query targets add them to the :bash:`data/Extensive Target Information` excel sheet.
